# HuggingFace Timm model benchmarks

## Introduction
THe [pytorch-image-models](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/tree/main/results) hosts the benchmarks of different models on the ImageNet dataset. However, these results are missing the "mdoel size" metric, which helps in making comparisons. Model_size is especially better for the following reasons,
1. **Resource Constraints**
2. **Practical Performance**
3. **Ease of Deployement**
